// {1} --------- HOW JS works ------------- 


// --------- Execution Context --------

// 1st component - Memory or variable environment (key:value , a= 10, fn. ...)

// 2nd component - Code or Thread of Execution (code executed one line at a time )


// JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language (execute one command at a time and in a specific order one the first line ended then goes to other )


// ------------------------- How JS Code is Executed ---------------------------------

// 1st phase -- Memory Creation  (gives "undefined" keyword to the variables)
// 2nd phase --  Code Execution ()

// -----------  Call Stack --------------
// diffrent names of call stack are : 1. Execution context stack , 2. Program stack , 3. Control stack , 4. Runtime stack , 5. Machine stack

// global exexcution context is goes into the stack 
// Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts
